Chuck.py fetches a random Chuch Norris joke from http://www.icndb.com/ whenever "!joke" is commented

Chess.py is in the works; goal is to support text and comment based games between Reddit users.
Ideally, a reddit user comments "Chess challenge!" and another user can comment "Move pawn from ___ to ___."
The algorithm should determine whether that move is legal. If so, my Reddit bot will comment a text-based representation of the chess board.
The algorithm should also determine whether a board has reached checkmate.
